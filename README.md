# openjscad-react

React.js bindings for the OpenJSCAD.org project

### TODOs

-   Add Jest tests w/ JSDom
-   Add Prettier
-   Add Storybook

### Known Issues

-   Storybook not loading up examples in Safari on MacOS and iOS
-   Cannot instantiate multiple `OpenJSCAD` components on the page simultaneiously (this may be due to limitations in the `@jscad/web` package, but I'm positive)
-   Else?
